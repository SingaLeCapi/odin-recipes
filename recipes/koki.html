    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Koki Beans is a traditional dish of my village in Cameroon. It is also one of the
        favourite dishes of many Cameroonians back home, as well as the diaspora. The Koki
        Beans looks like a cake, yellow in colour, soft and very tasty.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 cups skinless black-eyed- peas
        </li>
        <li>
            Â½ medium onion
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup palm oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper optional
        </li>
        <li>
            3 teaspoon salt or more
        </li>
        <li>
            3 cups chopped fresh spinach
        </li>
        <li>
            3 1/2 cups water
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Soak the dry beans in a good quantity of water to soak overnight.
        </li>
        <li>The next day, wash the beans by rubbing them between your hands and changing water. 
            When the beans are clean, sieve and put them aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend the beans and habanero pepper using a blender. Avoid putting a lot of water 
            while blending. Pour the blend into a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Warm the palm oil into a pan, just bring it to a lukewarm state.</li>
        <li>Mix the blend for a while, then add salt and the lukewarm palm oil progressively.
            Keep mixing until it is well combined.
        </li>
        <li>Pour lukewarm water into a bowl, add the limestone (if you have it) into it and mix.</li>
        <li>Add that water into the koki mixture and mix. Have a taste to check if the salt is enough,
            if not adjust.
        </li>
        <li>Clean the Banana leaves. Take 2 leaves at a time and place them crosswise (on top of each other)
            over an eating bowl
        </li>
        <li>Pour in a small portion of the koki mixture. Join the ends of the leaves to the centre and tie it
            with a kitchen string
        </li>
        <li>Pour a cup of water into a big pot, place a leaf at the bottom, then place the bundle into the pot.
            Let it cook for at least 1 hour. Make sure you check and add water regularly to avoid burns.
        </li>
    </ol>
