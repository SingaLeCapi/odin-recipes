        </li>
        <li>
            1 (scotch bonnet) pepper - optional, hot
        </li>
        <li> 
            4 lbs Cocoyams, small Canned Goods
        </li>
        <li>
            4 cups Beef stock Baking & Spices
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tsp Achu spices, powdered
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tsp Baking soda
        </li>
        <li>
            2g Salt
        </li>
        <li>
            2 Seasoning
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup Palm oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Warm palm oil in a skillet (frying pan) for about 1 minute. Do NOT bleach it. Pour the 
        all ingredients except the meat and fish into a blender. Pulse until it is well mixed and 
        yellowish. Taste to ensure that seasoning is perfect. Add a little salt if needed.You might 
        find some bubbles at the top of the soup. That is totally okay.</li>
        <li>Pour over the meat/fish and mix. Alternately, you could keep the meat seperately 
            from the soup and put it on the side while serving. Serve with some achu!</li>
        <li>Wash cocoyams and place in a pot with skin on. If also using large cocoyams (“mami coco”)
            and “achu banana”, place the large cocoyams at the bottom of the pot then add in the small
            cocoyams.
        </li>
        <li>Boil until cocoyams are soft and the skin comes off easily.</li>
        <li>While they are still warm, peel and process to a paste in a food processor. Traditionally, 
            they are pounded in a mortar but a food processor can do the job though it might not give 
            you a very smooth paste.
        </li>

    </ol>
